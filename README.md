## GCE Billing Tracker

This is a simple yet very useful bash script which automatically shows you your current billing cost of a Google Cloud VM Compute instance live and accurately.

What this includes is:
1. Live cost tracking of an instance (based on current exchange rate) 
2. View of past active instance sessions with their cost
3. Automatic system hardware detection for determining accurate billing cost

This is very handy to ensure you don't go over your billing account especially since the billing usage shown by google is 24-48hours delayed.

Feel free to let me know changes/additions to be made :)
